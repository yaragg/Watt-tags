      "description": "Gerard is a talented magician, responsible for much of the success of the famous Envision Destiny cruise ship. He's also one of those people. You know, one of those people who just seem to take up all the space they come across with their arrogance and confidence. You wouldn't wanna touch their personality with a 10-foot pole, but still people admire them. That is beyond Frank. Working behind the cruise ship bars and seeing Gerard pretty much every day, he can't understand what's so great about him. Besides, everybody else doesn't have to deal with his snide remarks and rude comments. Because if there's one thing Gerard seems to love, it's the act of constantly pestering Frank.\n\n \n\n \n\nStory credits goes to innocent_wolves on livejournal.com",

      "description": "The King's magician, Harlock Cooper, the greatest magician that ever lived - has just died.\n\nNow it's in the hands of the aged and weary Grand Magic Master, Wenward Marning, to scour the kingdom and find a suitable replacement in time to prevent a war. He sets out on the task with the knowledge that he can never find anyone as great as Harlock Cooper - Or can he?\n\nMarning meets Rat, a curious, rough-tempered street boy with a particularly keen talent for magic. Torn by grief, rage and the desire for revenge, Rat reluctantly places his loyalties to his street family aside and focuses on becoming the kingdom's magical champion. However, there is more to Rat than meets the eye, and he is the only one who can uncover who - or what - he truly is.\n\nTogether, Rat and Marning, boy and elder, work through their differences as they face a slowly unraveling web of conspiracy, treason, betrayal and revenge: and along with it, the dark reality of a terrible curse coming their way.\n\n[Will be updated twice weekly!]\n\nAmazing cover by @seventhstar",
